# PSpec -- RSpec for Perl 6

## Introduction

PSpec is an implementation of Ruby's RSpec library, in Perl 6.
It's currently very minimal, and does not implement much of RSpec.

## Status

 * Supports basic "describe" commands.
 * Supports a very simplistic "should" statement.
 * Has eq(), lt() and gt() subs that perform simplistic tests.

## TODO

Lots. This is barely functional, but is pretty much back to the level of
the last working version prior to the rewrite.

## Credits

Well, I must send cudos to the original authors of RSpec and Cucumber,
without them, this wouldn't exist.

Also, a big cheers to Carl Masak, who is always friendly and helpful!
And a call-out to Larry Wall whose help on the #perl6 channel has been 
greatly appreciated! I guess I should also thank him for creating Perl :-)

Since writing the original version of this Credits section, I've received
a lot of help and feedback from many people on the #perl6 channel. Thanks
to the whole Perl 6 community for being awesome!
